# auto hosters

### `softlockHoster.hex`
this will allow you to auto host the same pokemon **without** losing your rolling den
- roll to your desired shiny frame, face the den
- move your cursor over the Pokemon Camp option in the menu (***required step***, explanation [here](#soft-lock-explanation))
- close the menu
- navigate to change grip/order menu (switch home -> controllers)
- plug in your arduino

### `rollHoster.hex`
this will roll 3 frames forward, host the den & repeat
- save in front of the den, facing it
- navigate to change grip/order menu (switch home -> controllers)
- plug in your arduino

## soft lock explanation
this method utilizes the backup save in swsh.
multiple things in the game create a backup save, such as saving, trading, camping & flying.
by camping, your backup save will contain the pokemon you rolled on your shiny frame, while your original save will be untouched.

other uses include:
- closing the game & preserving your soft lock 
- hosting locally while soft locking
- keeping a pokemon soft locked while rolling for something else
